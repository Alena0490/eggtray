Entry level candidates API

## Add yourself

If you're looking for an entry level software engineering job, send a Pull Request adding a new YAML file to the [./profiles](./profiles) directory. Each YAML file in that directory represents a profile of a single person:

- Name of the file must be your GitHub username
- The file must have the `.yml` extension
- See existing files to learn about the format of the YAML document

Once the PR gets accepted, Eggtray uses [hen](https://github.com/juniorguru/hen) to inspect your GitHub profile. It merges the findings with data from the YAML file and creates a single data structure, which is then available in the API as your profile information.

If you want to change something in the YAML, send another PR. If you found a job (congratulations!) and now want to remove yourself from the API, send a PR removing your YAML file.

> [!NOTE]
> The API updates only once a day. If you change someting on your GitHub profile or in your YAML file, it can take up to 24 hours to take effect in the API.

## API usage

Open [juniorguru.github.io/eggtray/profiles.json](https://juniorguru.github.io/eggtray/profiles.json). That's it! As of now, there are no limitations on what you can do with the API. You can use the data for any purpose, even commercial, and there is no rate limiting.

The API has been created for the purpose of listing entry level candidates on [junior.guru/jobs](https://junior.guru/jobs/), but is open to anyone. If you use the API, [file an issue](https://github.com/juniorguru/eggtray/issues) and let's link your project from this document.

> [!CAUTION]
> As of now, the API is extremely **UNSTABLE**. There are no guarantees on schema of the response. Anything can and **will** change over night.
